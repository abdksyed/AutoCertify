# AutoCertify
Automating Certificate Creation 

## Objective:
The application automates the entire task Creating Certificates and mailing each student indivdually based on marks from the Student's Database(.csv).

The app should be able to be run from command line or directly running the script. The app also have all the defaults set, so not passing any arguments will use the defaults, which is not advised as it has demo email id of the sender and demo password.

The app can be provided with a template certificate Image, which will be used to print all the students details. The template which is used by default is:
!(Template)[certificates/CertificateTemplate.jpg]




#### Under Development
